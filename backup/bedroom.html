      <h2>Bedroom</h2>
      <h2>(Second Modeling Project of the Year)</h2>
      <p class="indent">This project was our second project in CAWD. We had to design a Bedroom using Maya and had to make it realistic. This was the project where we learned basically all the useful tools and were able to use them to the best extend possible. A lot of the bedrooms looked very photo-realistic, and acknowledge that this was our second project of the whole year using Maya. I was pretty proud of myself and everybody else around me for learning all these tools.</p>
      <p class="indent">Our goal was to create as close to a realistic model of our Bedroom from home. At the beginning of the project, my bedroom didn’t look that great, and I fell behind quite a bit. It didn’t look great at all and I didn’t even know how to use mental ray to create realistic shadows. Once I got home one day, I looked up a bunch of Beginner Maya tutorials and looked back at the Cawd day plans to figure out everything. The next week when our bedrooms were due, my bedroom looked quite beautiful, and I was very proud in what I accomplished for only our second project of using Maya.</p>
      <p class="indent">The great process of creating The Bedroom was entirely using Maya. This was a complete solo project, we had to start off making simple shapes and shape them into walls. We would begin making the biggest elements first and put all the little things in later. I started with my bed, my computer desk, and then my bookshelf, then started modeling the little things that went onto all of them. About 75% through this project, Mr. Cronin introduced us on how to model cords, you would just get the end of a cylinder, use the bezier tool to create a line segment, then extrude it. You can use the axis tool to move and shape the cord to your liking, shrink it, then place it where you want.</p>
      <p class="indent">In this project, we learned basically all the important things that we needed to learn in Maya. I learned a lot of things at home by looking up tutorials and practicing a lot. This is a field that I really want to get a job in. Either video game design, or website design.</p>
