      <p class="indent">Recreating a website for Joyce’s Noodle House in Essex, Vermont for our web Diving assessments in CAWD. We had to provide a modern looking, stylistic version that would apply nicely.</p>
      <p class="indent">We were instructed to create the Joyce’s Noodle House website with three tabs. “Home, About, and Menu”. I used warm, bright colors and high resolution images to show off all the texture on the meat for attraction.</p>
      <p class="indent">I started by making the homepage. First, the navbar, onto the header, and then body paragraphs. I chose a picture of meat for the header with text displaying “Joyce’s Noodle House.” I used Rule of Thirds to nicely display the food and so the text could be shown in great contrast on the left. I then moved on to the menu, here is where I created a menu that had different stylistic sections to each category of food. Artistic fonts and prices with nice descriptions. For the about page I just provided an image of the restaurant, some history and how to reach them. To finish it off, I placed the Color Palette I used for the website and left a link for the client of my next assignment.</p>
      <p class="indent">In the end, I thought this a pretty well made website. It looked nice and has a very modern appeal. I would change the contact page, I didn’t make it very responsive since I pushed that part off almost last minute. I placed all of the flex boxes proportionally using a flex wrapper so they could be side by side. I would’ve made them separate into a column when the screen got smaller. This website enhanced my skills with using flex and has allowed me to make certain things because of me making this site.</p>
