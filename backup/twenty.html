      <h2>Creating a Motherboard</h2>
      <h2>(Modeling Project)</h2>
      <p class="indent">My task for this project was to create my motherboard from my PC in Maya. I had to create three renders to show off my work. This work was rendered using the Mental Ray plugin (Realistic shadow and texture renderer for Maya) to create a very nice looking project.</p>
      <p class="indent">I had to create a very nice looking design of my motherboard from home. I had to start off with the motherboards flat texture so I could model on top of the image and then create the Bevel (3d model of a flat design) to create certain parts then work my way to other pieces.</p>
      <p class="indent">As I stated in the Concept, the motherboards flat texture was needed to be created first so I could work my way to other pieces in the design. I modeled the small pieces of hardware first so I could get those out of the way such as the little cmos batteries as you can see in front of the first picture, then I worked my way to the heat sink which you can see on the left. I then started working on the RAM slots and then worked my way towards the two GPU slots. These renders were probably the best ones that I have done so far throughout the year. The renders have the best lighting I have done and the best models with nice, bright color. The modeling was very accurate and very photo realistic.</p>
      <p class="indent">There is nothing on this project that I would like to change. I did accidentally not email Mr. Cronin after I linked the Week 32 folder on my CAWD Portfolio page. I got two days credit taken off so I wish I would’ve emailed him so I didn’t get a C because I put a lot of effort into it.</p>
